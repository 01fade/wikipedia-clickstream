# Wikipedia Clickstream Data Exploration

The Wikipedia Clickstream dataset contains counts of (referer, resource) pairs extracted from the request logs of Wikipedia. A referer is an HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage that linked to the resource being requested. The data shows how people get to a Wikipedia article and what links they click on. [Documentation here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_clickstream).

This exploration takes the .tsv for English Wikipedia from March 2020 that is available [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/clickstream/). There are other languages available.
